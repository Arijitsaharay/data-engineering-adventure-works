**ðŸš€ End-to-End Azure Data Engineering Project**

**Overview**

This project showcases a complete data engineering pipeline using Azure services, demonstrating expertise in scalable, efficient, and insightful data processing.

**Project Workflow**

**Azure Data Factory:** Extracted Adventure Works data from a GitHub repository and loaded it into the Bronze layer of an Azure Data Lake.

**Azure Databricks & PySpark:** Processed raw data from the Bronze layer, applied transformations, and stored the refined data in the Silver layer.

**Azure Synapse Analytics:** Conducted advanced transformations and structured data into tables in the Gold layer for analytical insights.

**Power BI:** Developed interactive dashboards to visualize data and drive business intelligence.

**Key Highlights**

âœ… Implemented a multi-layered data lake architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold).
âœ… Utilized Databricks and PySpark for scalable data processing.
âœ… Leveraged Azure Synapse Analytics for high-performance data warehousing.
âœ… Designed interactive Power BI dashboards to extract meaningful business insights.
